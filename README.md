# pixelscamp-20161007

Meant to be viewed with [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp) markdown presentation tool:

```
$ mdp pixelscamp-20161007.md
```

The unit files demonstrated in the talk are in `unit-files/final`.

You probably have no use for the `scripts` folder; I use them in my talk to copy unit files across to /etc.
